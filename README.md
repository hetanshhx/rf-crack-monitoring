**RF Crack Monitoring using Dual Microstrip Patch Antennas**

For this project, an antenna sensor is proposed for sensing, measuring, and quantifying crack growth and monitoring expansion in concrete structures. The sensor consists of two identical patch antennas arranged closely side by side on the same plane. When the distance between the two antennas is varied, the isolation coefficient increases and the mutual coupling between them increases. By employing this principle the crack growth can be monitored.
